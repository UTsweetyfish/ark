In this folder is a general template of what one needs to implement
support for a plugin using the cli interface in ark.

Here are the steps.

1. First, create a copy of the cliplugin folder
2. Change plugins/CMakeLists.txt to include the new subfolder
3. Rename the kerfuffle_cli.json_TEMPLATE to a unique name, for example
kerfuffle_rar.json.
4. Fill in the parts in the json metadata marked with TODO
5. Update the plugins/yourplugin/CMakeLists.txt file, replacing all
instances of kerfuffle_cli with kerfuffle_yourplugin (where yourplugin
		must be a unique plugin name)
6. Implement/modify cliplugin.cpp to fit your archive type.
Refer to kerfuffle/cliinterface.h for explanations on the values that
needs to be implemented. The class name does not need to be changed

Then finally, email the plugin to the ark maintainer for a code review before
it is committed to master :D

Have fun
